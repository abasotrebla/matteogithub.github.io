identification over task-induced intra-class and inter-class variations</a>
<br>Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters.
<br>My comments: this is a study where we evaluated the response of different connectivity metrics to EEG-based subject identification. We have replicated the analysis over different tasks, using both a within-task and a between tasks approach. Although the performance clearly decreases when the same subject is tested using profiles from different tasks, it is still evident that the connectivity metrics less robust to volume conduction and signal leakage allow to obtain higher performance. Does it mean that the subject-specific signature derived from scalp EEG is mainly due to some source of noise?

Lai, M., Demuru, M., Hillebrand, A. and Fraschini, M. (2018).
<br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-30869-w">A comparison between scalp-and source-reconstructed EEG networks</a>
<br>Scientific reports, 8(1), 12269.
<br>My comments: in this study, we compared results obtained from scalp and source EEG connectivity and network. The main idea was that although the two approaches use different assumptions, conclusions drawn regarding the topology of the underlying networks should, ideally, not depend on the approach. We found a strong correlation for the global connectivity between scalp- and source-level. In contrast, the network topology was only weakly correlated. In particular, not only the magnitude of network measures may change from scalp to source analysis, but even the direction of the effect may be the opposite (still depending on the FC metric), further suggesting caution when interpreting this kind of results.
