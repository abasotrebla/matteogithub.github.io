<br><a href="https://matteogithub.github.io/files/Biometrics_FC_comparison_oneDS__preprint_.pdf">Robustness of functional connectivity metrics for EEG-based personal
identification over task-induced intra-class and inter-class variations</a>
<br>Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition Letters.
<br>My comments: this is a study where we evaluated the response of different connectivity metrics to EEG-based subject identification. We have replicated the analysis over different tasks, using both a within-task and a between tasks approach. Although, the performance clearly decrease when the same subject is tested using profiles from different tasks, it is still evident that the connectivity metrics less robust to volume conduction and signal leakage allow to obtain higher performance. Does it mean that the subject specific signature derived from scalp EEG is mainly due to some source of noise?
