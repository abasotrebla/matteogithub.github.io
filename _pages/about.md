Short bio

Research interests: Brain, Networks, Behaviour
======
My main research interests orbit around these three keywords: <b>Brain, Networks, Behaviour</b>. These three elements and their multiple combinations are present in all my peer reviewed studies.

Brain
------
Most of my research focuses on the human brain. As the brain is a network, I have developed extensive knowledge in brain networks from the level of neurons up to the large scale interactions between brain regions. I am particularly interested in subcortical areas and their role in cognition and psychiatric disorders. I also study the interaction between individuals using quantitative approaches, by modelling how more brains synchronise with each other with methods such as Intersubject Synchronisation and Intersubject Dynamic Functional Connectivity. I work with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI, sMRI, dMRI, MRA, CBV), Positron Emission Tomography (mu-opiods receptors, serotonin receptors and transpotrters, dopamine), and sometimes also with electrophisiology (MEG, EEG). I also have a passion for meta-analysis and web-based tools to study and discover the vastness of brain imaging data.

Networks
------
Networks are ubiquitous. Furthermore, networks (graphs) are a powerful mathematical tool to model knowledge, social interaction, mental disorders and biological networks like the brain. I am specifically interested in multi-layer networks and how graph modelling of each layer can act as a bridge between phenotype, behaviour and brain-based measurement.


Behaviour
------
Studying the brain without behaviour is like trying to understand a car without ever driving it. Behaviour is the most fascinating of the three concepts I am interested in, as we experience it daily alone and during interactions with others. Specifically, I am interested in emotions and the role of the body in our mental perception. I am also interested in quantifying behaviour with clinical populations, to design tools to aid individuals and their therapists in understanding behaviour using web-based and smartphone-based technologies. I have developed tools for self-reporting complex body responses due to emotions or other psycho-physiological processes. I have developed web tools for massive online data collection. I am also interested how individuals synchronise with each other using dynamic behavioural and physiological measures.
