I am Matteo Fraschini, Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering University of Cagliari. My research activity is about Brain Networks in MEG and EEG. You can see the <a href="/publications/">list of all my publication here</a>. Here you can see my <a href="http://people.unica.it/matteofraschini/">Institutional web page</a>. In the <a href="/literature/">Literature page</a> I will write few comments on recent papers on M/EEG connectivity and Network analysis.
