**Abstract** 

The idea to estimate the correlation among (interacting) signals recorded using M/EEG systems has motivated numerous researchers to investigate how the resulting networks (defined by the correlation pattern) may reorganize themselves under any conceivable scenario. Countless studies have been published in the last decade where these correlation patterns have been extracted, both at scalp and source level, and successively correlated for example with behavioral and clinical parameters. Even though this idea is not at initial stages, its application is still far to be widespread. One of the concurrent causes may probably be related to the proliferation of numerous and different approaches aimed to estimate the correlation among these signals. Despite the substantial difference in estimating the correlation patterns, all these approaches promise to catch the real (less noisy) functional connectivity (correlation) among the (interacting) units (i.e., channels/sensors/regions) so generating confusion and hindering the proper comparison among different studies. Not only all these different metrics go under the same name (functional connectivity) but they have been (often) tested and validated using different approaches, therefore, making it very difficult understanding to what extent they are similar or not. It seems that the rate of growth of novel (or simply different) metrics is not in line with the development of methods that may help to validate the proposed approach. The lack of this validation step makes the choice of any metric in a specific study absolutely arbitrary, with the tangible risk to generate additional noise in the literature on functional connectivity.
